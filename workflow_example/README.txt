Example of the analysis workflow


In this section, we will work with Barro Colorado Island (BCI) data as an example of the data cleaning/wrangling and modeling pipeline used in the analysis of the 21 ForestGEO plots.

The source of the data is available at the Dryad repository:

> Condit, Richard et al. (2019), Complete data from the Barro Colorado 50-ha plot: 423617 trees, 35 years, Dryad, Dataset, https://doi.org/10.15146/5xcp-0d46.

As stated in the Abstract of the dataset:

> "The 50-ha plot at Barro Colorado Island was initially demarcated and fully censused in 1982, and has been fully censused 7 times since, every 5 years from 1985 through 2015. Every measurement of every stem over 8 censuses is included in this archive.(..) This is the 2019 version of the database, frozen as of 30 May 2019."
